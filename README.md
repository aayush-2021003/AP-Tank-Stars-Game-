### AP-Tank-Stars-Game-
This is an AP Group Project in which we made a Tank fight simulation game similar to Tank Stars available on google play and app store

### Description
This is the LibGDX version of the TankStars game, which executes its basic functions and gameplay. The game allows two players to play turn by turn, starting by choosing their tanks and then moving, aiming and firing at their opponent's tank to decrease their health. The tanks also have fuel, which is limited and the fuel bar keeps on decreasing as the tank moves. The game is won when one player is defeated by reducing their health to zero. TankStars games involves the features of pausing, resuming and restarting a game at any given time, and also saving the current game (such that all the current data related to health, fuel, positions etc. is saved) so that it can be played later.

This project involves the major concepts of Object Oriented Programming, with relation between classes, their objects and functions being implemented. Serialization has been implemented to save and store the games, as well as concepts of design patterns.
